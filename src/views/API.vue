        <h1>Composition API</h1>
        <p>
            The Composition API is an addition to the Vue framework created to address the limitations of the Options API used in Vue 2. The Composition API provides a way to manage reactivity in an application without compromising code organization and readability. As an alternative to the Options API offers more benefits. With the Composition API, you can restructure data, method, computed, and watch, in a clearer structure.
