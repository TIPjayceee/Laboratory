        T.I.P.’s first site was the Lorenzana Building in Quiapo, Manila. The
school had an initial enrollment of 2,400 which steadily increased
throughout the years, prompting the school to slowly but surely
expand. In 1967, it set up its main site at G. Puyat Street, Quiapo,
Manila. T.I.P. then directed itself towards specialization in the
field of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course
in Marine Engineering. Then in 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education, and
High School programs were phased out to make way for the school’s new
thrust. In 1981, additional buildings were leased and the T.I.P. P.
Casal, Quiapo location was opened to accommodate the growing student
population which had reached over 23,000. T.I.P. Arlegui was opened
three years later across P. Casal, both areas being collectively known
as the T.I.P. Manila campus. Currently, T.I.P. Manila has four (4)
main buildings across the combined 2.3-hectares of the two sites. The
founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along 20th Avenue of Cubao
as their answer to the Philippine government’s call for dispersal to
decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the years, the Quezon
City campus acquired adjacent properties, including a frontage along
Aurora Boulevard in the early 2000s. At present, T.I.P. Quezon City
has ten (10) main buildings spread out in its 3.3-hectare site. <br /><br />
