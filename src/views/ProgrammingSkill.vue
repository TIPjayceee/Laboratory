    <h2>Android Programming</h2>
<p>
Android is a platform for mobile devices, which includes an OS,
middleware and some key applications. The OS is based on a variant of
Linux kernel. On top of the kernel is a Java virtual machine called
Dalvik that is specially designed for embedded systems. Google has
released Android SDK along with its first Android phone G1. The SDK
allows developers to create applications for the Android platform
using Java and Eclipse-based IDE. This hands-on course aims to teach
all the important aspects of the Android platform.<br /><br />

<h2>Java Programming</h2>
<p>
Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software
for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application,
the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems
(OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its
syntax from the C and C++ programming languages. Java was developed in
the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with
Sun Microsystems, together with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton.
